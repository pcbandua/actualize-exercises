Hi my name is Paulo Bandua and I live in Tacoma, WA. 
I have been a designer for 8 years, and currently run a social-impact creative buisness with my partner. 
I'd like to transition into software engineering becausse I am a maker at heart and want to learn to build apps that create social-impact. 
I've always loved tech since I was a child, and thisi s the next step for me to take.
My dream is to work as a Front-End Dev, Web Dev, or UX Designer in a mission-focused company or non-profit.
