# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


#Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all the numbers.

numbers = [10, 509, 3]

sum = 0 
index = 0

while index < numbers.length
    sum = sum + numbers[index]
    index = index + 1

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? no
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. loops
