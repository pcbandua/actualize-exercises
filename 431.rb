# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
# For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].

breathwork_timing = [4, 2, 8, 4, 2, 8, 4, 2, 8]

new_array = breathwork_timing.map { |breathwork_timing| breathwork_timing * 3}
pp new_array

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? no, but I was really close.
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. intermediate looping
