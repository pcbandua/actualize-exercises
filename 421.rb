# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

home = 55

if home == 10
    puts 0

else
    puts -1
end

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? Yes
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. Loops
