# QUESTION 1
# Write a method that takes in an array of numbers and returns the mean average.
# Then run the method and print the result.

heights = [5, 4, 6, 6, 5]

# def phone_heights(mean)
#     sum = heights.sum
#    return mean = sum / heights.length
# end

# puts phone_heights(mean)

def phone_heights
    sum = heights.sum
   return mean = sum / heights.length
end

puts phone_heights
