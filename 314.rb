# QUESTION 1
# Ancay ouyay igurefay histay neoay utoay?
# Pig Latin is a very sophisticated language in which 
# each English word is converted as follows: 
# The first letter of each word is removed from the beginning and added to the end. 
# Then, the letters 'ay' are added to the very end of the word.
# For example: hello = ellohay, pingpong = ingpongpay, marmalade = armalademay, etc.
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a single word 
# and prints out the Pig Latin version of that word.


#write program to ask user to enter question
# puts "Enter a word to turn it into Pig Latin"

#Give user opportunity to answer question
puts "Enter a word to turn it into Pig Latin"
puts input_word = gets.chomp

#write program that turns the string into an array
pig_latin = input_word.split(//)
puts pig_latin

#write program that takes the answer and removes the first letter of the word


#write program that takes the first letter ofthe word and adds it to the end of the word

#write program that adds the letters 'ay' to the end of the word

#write program that prints out the Pig Latin word
