# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters the word "stop".

# while 1 < 2
#     puts "word loop"
    
# end

while true
    puts "Enter your fav word"
    input = gets.chomp
    if input == "stop"
        break
    end
end


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? No
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. Looping
