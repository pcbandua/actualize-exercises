# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


#Write a while loop to print the numbers 1 through 10.

index = 1
while index <= 10
    puts index
index = index + 1
end



# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory? no
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow. 
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice. I needto keep practicing loops to get the syntax down.
