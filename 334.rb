# QUESTION 1
# Have the user enter 10 words, and allow for duplicate words. 
# After the user is done, the program will tell the user 
# which word was entered the most frequently.
# For example, if the user enters: 
#   apple, banana, orange, pear, apple, pear, apple, squash, apple, pear
# The program will say: "apple was your most common word"
# (That's because apple appeared in the user's list 4 times, more than any other word.)



#write  program that sends a message to the user asking them to enter 10 words with duplicates allowed
puts "Write down 10 words that descriobe the most common emotions you feel most frequently as you learn software engineering (duplicates allowed)"

#write a program that lets the user enter the 10 words
puts "Write down 10 words that descriobe the most common emotions you feel most frequently as you learn software engineering (duplicates allowed)"
swe_emotions = gets.chomp

#write a program that checks for any duplucated words 


#write a program that recognizes the most duplciated word

#write a program that prints the most duplicated word for the user to view
