# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Write a method that takes in a number and returns the number times two. Then run the method and print the result.

# def times_two(number)
#     puts "enter a number" 
#     number = gets.chomp    
#     return number * 2
# end

# def times_two(number)

def times_two(number) 
    return number * 2
end

pp times_two(77)

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
