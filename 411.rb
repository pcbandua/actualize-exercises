# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Write a method that takes in a number and returns the number times two. Then run the method and print the result.

# def initialize
#     puts "enter number"
#     number = gets.chomp
#     new_number = number * 2
# end
# puts new_number

def new_number(number)
    return number * 2
  end
  
  pp new_number(8)

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.
